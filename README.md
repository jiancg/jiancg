# Hey, I'm Jason ðŸ˜¼!

Iâ€™m a third-year Computer Science student at McMaster University, passionate about full-stack and iOS development.  
Welcome to my GitHub profile!

When I'm not busy smashing my keyboard I like to:
- throw around heavy circles at the gym
- destroying local pickup basketball at la fitness
- cooking and trying new recipes
